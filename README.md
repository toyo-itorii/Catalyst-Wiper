# Roadmap

1. Build the base : a script that will automate factory reset of Catalyst switches (3750 to begin with). It will work only when there's no friction (no rommon, nor password)

# Problem

How to script in Python a program that will factory reset a Cisco Switch (in this case 3750).

Let's start from easy and go up in difficulty :

1. Script that will factory reset the device once it's already booted up and ready for reset (no password nor other discrepancies)
